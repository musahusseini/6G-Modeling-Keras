## Problem Statement

The evolution towards 6G wireless communication necessitates innovative approaches for optimizing network performance, spectrum efficiency, and security to support demanding applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous networks. Traditional methods for network simulation and optimization often fall short in capturing the complex and dynamic nature of these advanced systems. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore and implement sophisticated, data-driven techniques capable of accurately modeling and predicting the behavior of 6G network components and performance metrics. This research addresses the challenge of effectively leveraging artificial intelligence, specifically regression techniques implemented with the Keras deep learning framework, to create accurate and efficient models for simulating and optimizing key aspects of mobile network technology in the context of 6G.

## Introduction

The transition from 5G to 6G represents a significant leap in wireless communication, promising unprecedented data rates, ultra-low latency, and ubiquitous connectivity for a multitude of intelligent systems. This advancement is crucial for enabling emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), and autonomous networks, which demand substantial improvements in network performance, spectrum utilization, and security. To meet these demands, innovative solutions are required to effectively design, simulate, and optimize the intricate architectures and protocols of 6G networks.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in revolutionizing RF communications, offering the potential to automate design processes, enhance network simulations, and refine signal processing methodologies. By employing deep learning frameworks such as Keras, AI-driven models can be developed to optimize antenna designs, allocate network resources efficiently, and mitigate interference, thereby accelerating the deployment of resilient and adaptive 6G infrastructures. This paper investigates the application of AI-driven regression techniques, implemented using the TensorFlow/Keras framework, for modeling key aspects of mobile network technology in the context of 6G. By focusing on regression, this research aims to develop predictive models capable of accurately simulating the complex relationships within 6G systems, laying the groundwork for future optimization and performance enhancement strategies.

## Methodology

The core of this project involves developing and evaluating regression models using Keras to predict various 6G network parameters. The general methodology includes:

1.  **Data Acquisition/Generation:** Depending on the specific 6G network aspect being modeled, data could be synthetic, simulated, or derived from existing research on advanced communication systems. The dataset should represent the input features and target output for the regression task.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** This crucial step involves cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the raw data to make it suitable for neural network training. This may include handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
3.  **Model Architecture Design:** Designing and implementing various neural network architectures (e.g., Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks for sequential data, Recurrent Neural Networks) in Keras, tailored for regression tasks.
4.  **Model Training:** Training the Keras models using appropriate optimizers, loss functions (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression), and batch sizes. Techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling may be employed.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using relevant regression metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error) on a separate test set.
6.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Iteratively adjusting model hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions, regularization) to optimize performance.

Specific details regarding the datasets used, feature engineering, and the exact Keras model architectures will be detailed within the Jupyter notebooks or script files.
